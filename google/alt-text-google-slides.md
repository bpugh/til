# Add alt text to presentation slides

Today I learned that you can add alt text to images in PowerPoint and Google Slides by right-clicking on an image.
It hadn't occurred to me before but it makes sense that it would be as important as alt text for images on the web if you're going to share your slides.
Likewise, you should mark an image as "decorative" if you want a screen reader to ignore it.

[This post](https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/) has some nice examples of how to write good alt text.
