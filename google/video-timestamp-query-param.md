# Specify timestamp in Google Drive video URL

#til that Google drive uses the same video player as Youtube so if you want to link to specific timestamp in a video you can append a URL parameter like `t=<number of seconds>`.

So if you want to share a link to video and have it start playing at 10:44, the url will look like `/view?t=644`.
