# One-time code autocomplete

I just discovered that there is a `autocomplete="one-time-code"` value you can use on mobile devices where the operating system will autopopulate the field with a code that the user receives via SMS.
I haven't had a chance to test it out but it seems pretty cool and I wish every banking site would just add this one html attribute (since they seem unable to add any MFA option other than SMS).
