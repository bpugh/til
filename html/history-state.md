# History API state

Today I learned that you can actually store state in the browser history via the [history API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) (note this is not the query string).

I came across in [this post](https://darekkay.com/blog/preserve-form-values/) that uses it as a clever method for temporarily storing form data.
