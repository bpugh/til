# Thin Space

Today I learned that there is an HTML entity called "thin space" that you can use when you need less space between two characters than the normal space.

The HTML code is `&thinsp;`

> Thin Space might be the most underrated HTML entity. It can be used for a name like J.â€ŠK. Simmons. Without spacing, the J and K would seem too close together; with a regular space, they seem too far apart. Insert a thin space and it is just perfect. - [Typography Manual](https://codepen.io/mikemai2awesome/full/qBygNwq)
