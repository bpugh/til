# DeepGit blame

Today I learned that [DeepGit](https://www.syntevo.com/deepgit/tour/) is actually completely free even for commercial use. This is the best git blame utility I've come across because it lets you continue drilling down into the history of a line, kinda like a recursive blame.
You do have to provide an email address to register but I think it's worth it.

It's from the same developer of my preferred git client SmartGit but SmartGit _does_ require a paid license for commercial use.
