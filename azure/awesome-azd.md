# Awesome AZD templates

Today I discovered the [Awesome AZD templates](https://azure.github.io/awesome-azd/) site which is essentially a curated gallery of a bunch of templates for deploying to Azure with the new [Azure developer cli](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview?tabs=nodejs).

There are even several for integrating with ChatGPT like [ChatGPT + Enterprise Data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp/).
