Today I learned

Inspired by [others](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) I've [seen](https://github.com/simonw/til) [do this](https://til.hashrocket.com/) and by the idea of [Learning in public](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9), I've created this repo to share TILs (Today I learned). I'm hoping this will motivate me to more consistently post things so feel free to poke me if it's been a while. I've been doing web dev for over a decade and still feel like I'm regularly learning things I "should have known" so hopefully this serves as a reminder that we're all just constantly learning.
