# lazydocker

Today I learned about a cool terminal UI tool for managing containers called [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker).
I'm not really working with Docker on my current project but I'm bookmarking it for later.

If you're a fan of [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), lazydocker is from the same author.
