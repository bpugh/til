# Podman is a nice alternative to Docker

Today I learned that Podman is a pretty nice alternative to Docker, and in my case was a drop-in-replacement for Docker Desktop.

The installation process was smooth and it really tries to guide you through the setup.

They even provide cli aliases for docker commands so you don't have to update any existing scripts.

Proponents also argue that it has more secure default feature like rootless containers.
