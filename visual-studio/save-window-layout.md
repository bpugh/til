# You can save window layouts in Visual Studio

If you go to `Window > Save Window Layout`, it'll [save your current window layout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022#create-and-save-custom-layouts) in Visual Studio.
For example, when I have to go from my monitor setup to just my laptop, I tend to set the solution explorer to auto-hide and make the Test Explorer smaller.

Now I can do it with just a keyboard shortcut!
