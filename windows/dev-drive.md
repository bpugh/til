# Windows Dev Drive

Today I learned about a new feature in Windows 11 called [Dev Drive](https://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2023/11/22/test-driving-windows-11-dev-drive-for-dotnet.html).

It sounds like it essentially lets you create an optimized drive or volume for heavy file I/O that could speed up large solutions or test suites.

Doesn't look like I'm able to enable this on my work laptop yet but I'm curious to try it on one of my personal machines and see if it's a noticeable improvement.
