# You can easily wrap text with HTML tags

Using the builtin [Emmet](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) functionality, you select any arbitrary text or HTML and wrap it with new markup by executing the command `Emmet: Wrap with Abbreviation` and typing an Emmet abbreviation.

I'm going to be using this all the time now!

It even understands JSX so it'll output `className` if you specify a css class.
