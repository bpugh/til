# HTTP files

#til about `.http` files that you can use to make/test requests to any api endpoint from within most IDEs/editors.

This started with the [Rest client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) vscode extension and then [Visual Studio 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/http-files?view=aspnetcore-8.0) added support somewhat recently.

It kinda acts like an alternative to something like Postman but without leaving your editor, but for me the nice thing is it can act like a runnable form of documentation for your api that you can commit alongside your code.
