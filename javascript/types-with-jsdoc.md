# Strong typing with JSDoc and Zod

You can get pretty good type checking in Javascript with just JSDoc comments and an editor like VS code or Visual Studio.
You'll get most of the same intellisense and warnings in your editor as you would with Typescript.

Combine this with a library like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) which can infer validation schemas from your types and you'll have runtime checking also!
