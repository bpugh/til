# Shell Check

Today I learned about [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) which is essentially a linter for bash scripts.

You can try it on the website but I recommend installing the [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck).
I like that you can look up the rationale for each of the rules so it's a great way to learn some best practices for bash scripts.
