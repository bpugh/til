# Press `ctrl+enter` to submit a comment on Azure DevOps

Pressing `ctrl+enter` in a comment field on Azure DevOps will submit the comment!
For some reason, this isn't listed on their [keyboard shortcuts page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/navigation/keyboard-shortcuts?view=azure-devops) but it's so much nicer than using the mouse or pressing `tab` four times.
