# View transitions API

Today I learned about the new [view transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions) and I was pretty impressed with how much of the heavy lifting the browser will now do for you to animate between states.

Adam Argyle has a [fun talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is1C2RDV4LI) where he shows what you can do with this new API.

I only had to add a couple of lines of javascript to animate reordering a list of items that would have required a more complicated technique like [FLIP (first last invert play)](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/) in the past.
